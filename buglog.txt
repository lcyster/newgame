- adding the item with the "find" command; should i even have a "find" and a "take" command or should i make them the same thing and add a drop command
- adding any item in your location into your inventory (probably an error with the difference between location inventory and player inventory?)
- "key" caps lock and having other names for the same item
- running "move" on a "find" prompt (clearly ai bug but idk)
- ai not reading "there is a door. the door is locked. it cannot be opened." and saying the door to the shed is ajar
- the ai forgetting that the key is in the inventory?
- the ai keeping the door open even though the description fed to it should say the door is locked
- inventory check saying the sword is in my inventory but the sword still being in the shed, finding another key (this bug is because it's adding things to my inventory using the "find" command but not removing items from the inventory location)

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any key in the forest. It seems there are no items for you to find here.

Congratulations! You have found a key in the forest. You pick it up and add it to your inventory.

- there's some sort of error with the find/take and the check inventory function. for some reason it won't pick up the key from inside the location and it confuses "check inventory" with the @find command
