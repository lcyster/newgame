- how to make entrance of the shed locked so that you can enter the shed?
-- shed needs to support a command "unlock" or something
-- to move to an area and go north/south/east/west/unlock or something
-- to tell it the things you can do and where it is
-- change shed to object?





- manage the commands
-- either shed is an object, or there is a thing that is objects/places
-- whenever in location: "for all objects at location, these objects support this command"
--- some would be "pick up", some would be "unlock" or "enter"
---- then would have new objects
--- universe would then describe itself by saying "in this location, you can preform these commands"




- get the ai to run through the list of items to see if there are homologous things within the inventory





finished -- 
- add inventory
