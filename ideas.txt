- how to make entrance of the shed locked so that you can enter the shed?
-- shed needs to support a command "unlock" or something
-- to move to an area and go north/south/east/west/unlock or something
-- to tell it the things you can do and where it is
-- change shed to object?


For example:
@move(north)

The following are the command formatting:
@move(direction) - This command changes the player's location. The action @move takes a parameter of direction. The available directions are north and south.
@describe or @location - This command prints the exact description of each location.
@take(item) - This command takes an item from the player's current location and adds it to their inventory. The action @take takes a parameter of item.
@checkInventory - This command prints out the items in the player's inventory.





- manage the commands
-- either shed is an object, or there is a thing that is objects/places
-- whenever in location: "for all objects at location, these objects support this command"
--- some would be "pick up", some would be "unlock" or "enter"
---- then would have new objects
--- universe would then describe itself by saying "in this location, you can preform these commands"




- get the ai to run through the list of items to see if there are homologous things within the inventory





finished -- 
- add inventory
